# This controller handles creation and updating of links of users to projects. 
# A User can be either an admin (username 'admin' only), a project lead, or a project editor.
#
# A user becomes a project lead currently (as of 1/2012) by simply creating a new project in the system. A project lead has
# the ability to create extraction forms and studies. A project lead can also assign users to their projects.
#
# A user becomes a project editor or collaborator when the project lead adds them via the project user management page. A 
# project editor/collaborator has the ability to create new studies within a project using existing extraction forms, and edit study data.
